#convolutionalRBM.m


A MATLAB / MEX / CUDA-MEX implementation of Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machines.

## General Information
Please refer to the [project introduction page on my website](http://qipeng.me/software/convolutional-rbm.html).

## Current status

The current version contains a tested **CPU version only**. The GPU code in this version is incompatible with the CPU implementation, and may result in memory leakage or other issues. The GPU version is still in development. Any updates will be posted here.

I have stopped maintaining this project at the moment.

CUDA compilation support for multiple platforms has not been thoroughly tested.

For general information on functions in this project, try `help function_name`, as most `.m` files in this project are self-documented.

Here's some questions from recent comments

* **How do I get the data and parameters for `trainCRBM?`**

You'll have to download a dataset on your own, and transform it to a format that is compatible with `trainCRBM`. For format of the input, try using the MATLAB `help` command on the function.

As for the `param` parameter in that function, try the `getparams` function for an example.

* **What is the `oldModel` parameter in `trainCRBM?`**

Firstly, this parameter is *optional*. That is, you can simply ignore it when you first train your CRBM.

This parameter sort of a fail-safe. As is known to researchers, CDBN's can take a relatively long time to train, and there's usually no guarantee for the system state of your machine running the traning process. Therefore, in my implementation, the model parameters are saved to a `.mat` file periodically during the training process.

In case your training was interrupted accidentally, you can load the intermediate model from the fail-safe `.mat` file, and use the model there as the `oldModel` parameter in this function. The training process will instantly continue based on the saved progress.
